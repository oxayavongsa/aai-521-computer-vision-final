### **üöÄ Project Overview**  - Active
In an age dominated by digital transformation, extracting actionable insights from unstructured visual data is a significant challenge across industries. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) serves as a powerful bridge between visual content and textual information, enabling applications like document digitization, automated data processing, and accessibility enhancements for individuals with disabilities.

Our project, developed for AAI-521: Computer Vision, explores the creation of a robust and versatile OCR pipeline. By leveraging state-of-the-art models‚ÄîEasyOCR and TrOCR‚Äîwe tackle diverse real-world challenges such as multilingual text, arbitrary orientations, and noisy image conditions. This pipeline provides a scalable and efficient solution, showcasing the potential of OCR technology to redefine data extraction. üåü

### **üìä Dataset**
We utilized the TextOCR Dataset, available on Kaggle:
üåê[**TextOCR: Text Extraction from Images Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/textocr-text-extraction-from-images-dataset)  

- **Source:** TextVQA images annotated for OCR tasks.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - 900,000+ word-level annotations.  
  - Annotated images with varied resolutions, orientations, and multilingual content.  
  - JSON labels for structured parsing.
    
- **Challenges Addressed:**
  - Diverse image qualities and text layouts.
  - Multilingual and curved text.
  - Noise from shadows, clutter, and distortions.

## **üõ† Technologies Used**  
  - Python: Programming language for data processing and modeling.
  - EasyOCR: Lightweight OCR model for simple layouts.
  - TrOCR: Transformer-based VisionEncoderDecoder model for complex and multilingual scenarios.
  - Jiwer Library: Evaluation metrics for WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate).
  - Hugging Face Transformers: Framework for implementing TrOCR.

### **üìä Results and Key Insights**

- TrOCR demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving:
  - WER: 1.00%
  - CER: 0.99%

- EasyOCR offered faster inference but struggled with complex layouts:
  - WER: 3.10%
  - CER: 3.87%

- Advanced preprocessing techniques‚Äîgrayscale conversion, binarization, and deskewing‚Äîsignificantly improved OCR performance.

- Both models excel in different scenarios:
  - EasyOCR is ideal for simple, structured text.
  - TrOCR is better suited for noisy, multilingual, or distorted text.
