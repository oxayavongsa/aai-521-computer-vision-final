## **🎯 Project Goals**
Our project seeks to tackle real-world challenges in **text recognition** by implementing:  
- **Advanced OCR Models**: EasyOCR and TrOCR for multilingual text recognition.  
- **Text Extraction Pipeline**: Preprocessing raw images, detecting text regions, and extracting meaningful content.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluating and fine-tuning models for real-world applications like document digitization, accessibility tools, and automation.

## **📊 Dataset**
We used the **TextOCR Dataset** from Kaggle:  
[**TextOCR: Text Extraction from Images Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/textocr-text-extraction-from-images-dataset)  

- **Source:** TextVQA images annotated for OCR tasks.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - 900,000+ word-level annotations.  
  - Varied image resolutions and text orientations.  
  - JSON labels for structured parsing.
