## **🚀 Project Overview**  - Active
In the modern era of digitization, extracting actionable insights from unstructured visual data is a pressing challenge across industries. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a pivotal tool that bridges the gap between visual content and textual information, with applications ranging from document digitization to accessibility enhancements for individuals with disabilities.

Our project, developed as part of AAI-521: Computer Vision, aims to create a robust and versatile OCR pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art models—EasyOCR and TrOCR. This pipeline is designed to handle multilingual text in diverse formats, including arbitrary text orientations and challenging real-world image conditions. 🌟
